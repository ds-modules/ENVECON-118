The researcher ran the following regression, where $Y_d$ = the log of stock price of the major airline on day d. The researcher has N=500 days of data. $Log(Number Cases)_d$ is the log of daily COVID-19 cases in the country, and $Accidents_d$ is a dummy variable equal to one if an airline accident occurred somewhere in the world on that day, and equal to zero otherwise.
