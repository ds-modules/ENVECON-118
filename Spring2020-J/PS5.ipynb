For more information on how to produce these types of tables, see the Coding Bootcamp Part 5 notebook posted on Datahub.\n",

Let the variable inter_pair= 0 or 1, where 1 means there was a similar patent filed in a certain geographic area in the US. You will use a linear probability model to compare the probability of interference between patent pairs above and below different co-location thresholds of inventors within 10, 50 and 100 miles. You will also estimate a logit specification, interpret marginal effects, and perform hypothesis testing. \n"

Let the dependent variable of all columns be the indicator of having a pair patent interference. For the regression in column 1, specify a constant (i.e. intercept) and `Treatment1` as regressors. In column 2, add to the constant and `Treatment1` the number of shared citations and then the number of subclasses shared.
