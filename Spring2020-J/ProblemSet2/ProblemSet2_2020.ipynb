    "This exercise should be completed using R . Remember, when you want output to show in the notebook, you need to *explicitly* call the object in your R code. For example, if I want to show the mean of food at home expenditures per capita (*FAHE*), I canâ€™t just type `MeanFAHE <- mean(FAHE)` because that will just save the output to `MeanFAHE`. Instead, I need to then type `MeanFAHE` on its own so it displays the output. __Answers that do not display any output will be graded as incorrect.__\n",

    "**hint:** the function `group_by()` in the `tidyverse` package might be helpful. Section 2 Notes will give some examples of how to use the function.) The function takes two arguments: first the name of the data, second the variable whose values we want to group on: `group_by(data, varname)`. Grouping the data doesn't modify the data itself, instead it changes how the data behaves when we pass it to other `tidyverse` functions. If when we use `summarise()` on our data after using `group_by()`, we will produce separate sets of summary statistics for each level of the grouping variable. \n",

If we then wanted to look at the average sleep per night and number of observations *split by gender*, we could run `summarise(sleep75, avg_sleep = mean(sleep), count = n())` which will yield a table that has two rows of summary statistics: one row for females (`male = 0`) and one row for males (`male =1`)\n",
