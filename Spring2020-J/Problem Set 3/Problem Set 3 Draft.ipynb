    "\n",
    "This exercise is based on the paper [Does Hazardous Waste Matter? Evidence from the Housing Market and the Superfund Program by Greenstone and Gallagher 2008](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/123/3/951/1928203?redirectedFrom=fulltext). This\n",
    "paper explores individualsâ€™ willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental quality by observing the\n",
    "impact of increasing environmental quality on housing prices. This method is known as the hedonic\n",
    "valuation method, whereby the price of a good is determined by each of its attributes. In the case of a house, its value is determined by all of its physical characteristics (e.g., number of bedrooms) as well as the characteristics of the neighborhood in which it is located (including environmental quality). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this paper, the change in environmental quality results from the cleanup of hazardous\n",
    "waste sites. The study focuses on Superfund sites, areas designated by the US government as\n",
    "contaminated by hazardous waste and that pose a hazard to environmental/human health. The\n",
    "EPA placed certain Superfund sites on the National Priorities List (NPL), which meant that these\n",
    "sites were legally required to undergo remediation. If individuals value environmental quality, then\n",
    "housing prices should increase after nearby NPL sites are cleaned up. To determine the extent to\n",
    "which individuals value the cleanup, we can compare housing close to a hazardous waste site that\n",
    "was cleaned up to *comparable* homes near a similar waste site that was not cleaned up.\n"

    "* Do **NOT** install packages on the server. All packages that you need to complete the assignment are already installedand can be loaded with the `library()` function. Trying to install packages will create conflicts and potentially require reloading a fresh copy of the notebook.\n",
    "* When submitting the notebook, do **NOT** include output of the entire dataset. This is a large dataset, and printing out all rows will take multiple pages of output and make it much harder for the GSIs to find your answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `xtable` and `stargazer` are two great packages for making tables. `xtable` is great for turning a dataframe into a table output, while `stargazer` is great for making a table of your regression results.$^2$ I recommend exploring these packages when you are making your summary statistics table and regression output table in this problem set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you google and find other R packages you would like to use, make sure you install them in your locally-installed RStudio. If you want to use new packages in DataHub to solve the problem set inside the Problem Set 3 notebook, let any of the GSI's know so they ask for those packages you want to use to be installed.  As mentioned, all packages that you need for this problem set are already installed and ready for use on Datahub.\n",
    "\n",
    "$^2$: `stargazer` is great for professional-looking LaTeX or postscript tables, but if you want to produce tables for your regression output in the notebook you will need to use `type = \"html\"` and then copy/paste the html output into a Markdown cell."
