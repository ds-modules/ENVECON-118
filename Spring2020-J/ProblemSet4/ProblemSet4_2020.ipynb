    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do **NOT** install packages on the server. All packages that you need to complete the assignment are already installed and can be loaded with the `library()` function. Trying to install packages will create conflicts and potentially require reloading a fresh copy of the notebook.\n",
    "* When submitting the notebook, do **NOT** include output of the entire dataset. This is a **large** dataset, and printing out all rows will take multiple pages of output and make it much harder for the GSIs to find your answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `xtable` and `stargazer` are two great packages for making tables. `xtable` is great for turning a dataframe into a table output, while `stargazer` is great for making a table of your regression results.$^2$ I recommend exploring these packages when you are making your summary statistics table and regression output table in this problem set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you google and find other R packages you would like to use, make sure you install them in your locally-installed RStudio. If you want to use new packages in DataHub to solve the problem set inside the Problem Set 3 notebook, let any of the GSI's know so they ask for those packages you want to use to be installed.  As mentioned, all packages that you need for this problem set are already installed and ready for use on Datahub.\n",
    "\n",
    "$^2$: `stargazer` is great for professional-looking LaTeX or postscript tables, but if you want to produce tables for your regression output in the notebook you will need to use `type = \"html\"` and then copy/paste the html output into a Markdown cell."
