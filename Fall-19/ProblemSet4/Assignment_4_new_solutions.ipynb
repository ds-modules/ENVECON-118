    "test= \\beta_0+\\beta_1 freecomp+u\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    " describes the effect of being offered a computer on test scores. In other words, the first specification is explicitly about ownership of a computer, irrespective of whether or not one had one before the random distribution, while the second specification is interested in the individual having been offered a computer, irrespective of whether or not one had one before the random distribution, and with no conclusion yet as to whether the individual accepted the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    " Regarding limitations: In the first specification, one might be worried about unobservables that are correlated with having computer that are also correlated with test scores. For example, students who are more driven academically and try harder on tests may also be those who will pressure their parents to purchase them computers to work on. Meanwhile, in the second specification, we don’t learn what the effect of computers are on test scores. Instead, we learn about the effect of the program’s offer, which may not exactly be our interest.\n"

We might also be concerned about other policies that may have been enacted at or close to the threshold.Finally, we would be worried about possible gaming around the threshold, which would motivate us to see if there are more individuals reporting just under or at 20% compared to right above 20%.
