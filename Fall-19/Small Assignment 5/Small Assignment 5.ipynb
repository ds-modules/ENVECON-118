    "While primary school is almost universal in Mexico, secondary education in rural areas is trailing behind the national average, especially among poor households. In order to increase school enrollment among the youth in poor rural families, in 1998 the Mexican government introduced the PROGRESA program. The program gives cash transfers to mothers in poor households if their children attend school regularly and receive periodical medical checkups. We will use a large data set collected by this program to better understand the determinants of school enrollment and evaluate the effects of the program. As mentioned in class, for a sample of 507 villages, the program was randomly assigned to some of them.\n",

    "The data `progresa.csv` consist of a subset of the children 13 years old that have just completed primary school. (You will find a result that differ from what we saw in class because this subsample only include children that are 13 years old)\n",
